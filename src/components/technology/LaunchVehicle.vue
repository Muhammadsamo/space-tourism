      A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to
      carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or
      beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation.
      Standing 150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch
      pad!
